The log-rank test compares the survival curves of treated vs. untreated groups.
Since the p-value is extremely small (essentially zero - 1.4226700137847922e-113), this indicates that there is a highly significant difference in the survival curves between treated and untreated patients.
There is strong evidence that the treatment has a **negative** impact on survival.
